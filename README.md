# Unsupervised Learning Project: Identifying Customer Segments

I completed this project as part of Term 1 of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. This project employs K-means clustering to identify clusters from demographic data. These clusters are then used to identify the main user base for a mail-order company by using the company's own customer data and identifying which clusters are most dominant. 

As well as identifying customer segments using clustering methods, this project also involved: extensive data wrangling/cleaning; preprocessing such as one-hot encoding, scaling, and imputation; feature engineering; and dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA).

Please see the Jupyter Notebook or HTML for a walk through of this project (please not the HTML is currently too large to view on GitHub and will need to be downloaded to view). 

Thank you for your time and interest!
